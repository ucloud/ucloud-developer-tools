# Open Source and Gift Culture

## Why Open Source?

Developer tools are all in open source, there are two reasons:

1. **Only open source can make user believe us**. Unlike other domain such as IaaS and PaaS products, most of the developer tools must be deployed on the client environment, which means that all the source code of the tool must be fully trusted by the customer, so publishing the source code becomes a necessary condition.
2. **Only open source can integrate with the community**. Many popular developer tools are not developed by a single cloud vendor, but are led by a third-part commercial or non-commercial organization (such as CNCF, Hashicorp, etc.), and multiple vendors (such as UCloud, etc.) are collaborate with. so open source has also become the conllaboration method between vendor and community.

## Gift Culture

The gift culture is also a important factory for vendor.

With the advent of the cloud-native era, open source software has sprung up. The growth of developer tools also follows the "**gift culture**" of open source software. This concept comes from *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* by Eric Raymond, which means that the contribution and gift of the open source community is not a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). The open source of developer tools will not cause economic losses to cloud vendors, but can get growing about the brand and user scales.

In the roadmap of UCloud's developer tools, the open source culture is very important. UCloud has continuation contribute to popular open source developer tools, such as `Terraform`, `Packer`, `Pulumi`, etc. In this way, we can always work with the community, so that users can use the tools their favorite.

At the same time, it can also use technical contributions to **feed back the development of the community**, accelerate the development of new technologies, and contribute to the basic software industry. push us forward to successful together.
