# Open Source and Gift Culture

English | [简体中文](./open-source_CN.md)

## Why Open Source?

Developer tools are all open source. There are two reasons:

1. **Only open source can make users believe us**. Unlike other domains such as IaaS and PaaS products, most developer tools must be deployed on the client environment, which means that the customer must fully trust all the source code of the tool, so publishing the source code becomes a necessary condition.
2. **Only open source can integrate with the community**. Many popular developer tools are not developed by a single cloud vendor, but are led by a third-part commercial or non-commercial organization (such as CNCF, Hashicorp, etc.), and multiple vendors (such as UCloud, etc.) are collaborating with. So open source has also become the collaboration method between vendor and community.

## Gift Culture

Gift culture is a concept that comes from *The Cathedral and the Bazaar* by Eric Raymond. The growth of developer tools also follows the "**gift culture**" of open-source software, which means that the contribution of the open-source community is not a [zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game). The open-source of developer tools will not cause economic losses to cloud vendors, but can get growing about the brand and user scales.

In the roadmap of UCloud's developer tools, the open-source culture is very important. UCloud has continuation contributed to popular open-source developer tools, such as `Terraform`, `Packer`, `Pulumi`, etc. In this way, we can always work with the community, so that users can use the tools their favorite.

At the same time, it can also **contribute back to development of the community**, accelerate the development of new technologies, and contribute to the basic software industry. Push us forward to success together.
